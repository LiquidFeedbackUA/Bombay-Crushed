Bombay Crushed Prototype
========================

This is a collection of prototypical code for [Bombay Crushed](https://saftigekumquat.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/bombay-crushed/), a new UI for [Liquid Feedback](http://liquidfeedback.org/) currently developed by [Saftige Kumquat](https://saftigekumquat.wordpress.com/).

Where to start?
---------------

`apicli.js` contains code that, when executed via [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) connects to the [Liquid Feedback API Test Server](http://apitest.liquidfeedback.org:25520/) and pulls some information.

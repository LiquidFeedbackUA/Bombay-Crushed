sort by timestamp in RESULT.closed and choose youngest finished issue
I refer to the resulting issue as RES

get numbers of the initiatives in the found issue:

    GET /initiative

            issue_id = RES.id
        initiative options
            initiative_winner=True

data needed for the pie chart, get Voters:

    WINNER.positive_votes => pVoters
    WINNER.negative_votes => nVoters

direct = 0
indirect = 0
for pv in pVoters:
    if pv.delegate_member_id != NULL:
        direct += 1
        indirect += pv.weight -1

same for nVoters
